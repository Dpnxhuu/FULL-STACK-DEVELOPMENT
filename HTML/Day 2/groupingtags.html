      Breaking news from <span class="location">Mars Colony Alpha</span>! Scientists have discovered a new type of crystal that glows in the dark. The team leader, <span class="highlight">Dr. Sarah
      Johnson</span>, announced this finding on <span class="date">October 25th</span>. The crystals, nicknamed "Starlight Stones," emit a bright blue glow when exposed to the cold
      Martian night. Researchers believe these crystals could revolutionize lighting systems in future space colonies.

      These stones can also be used to create a new type of glass that is stronger and lighter than any other material. Further testing is needed
      however Dr. Sarah Johnson confirmed that their research was in the right direction.

      In related news, the <span class="location">Luna Station</span> has reported successful testing of their new gravity generators. The project, led by <span class="highlight">Dr. Maria Rodriguez</span>,
      completed its final phase on <span class="date">23rd</span>. These developments mark a new chapter in human space exploration, with both Mars and Moon bases
      making significant progress in sustainable living conditions.

      Meanwhile, more equipment will have to be transported to the moon to support the new base. The company tasked with this project is already
      preparing for the upcoming mission.
